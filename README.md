# Sorting-Visualizer

We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.
