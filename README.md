# Sorting-Visualizer

We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.

Thatâ€™s why I'm making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.


The figure below is the capture of the working of my project.
